h2. About

Infero is a graphical user interface for Logic Analyzers.

It currently only support saleae-logic-libusb [1] as the underlying
Logic Analyzer. Support for other logic analyzers will have to be
added by others.

h2. How to build

First, make sure you thave the required dependencies installed.
Maven will let you know if you don't.

To build Infero simply type

pre. mvn clean install

from the git checkout.

If something should be wrong with the tests, add @-Dmaven.test.skip@
and the build will succeed even if some of the tests fail.

Infero depends on an unreleased version of the "GUTS - Guice Utilities
& Tools Set" (GUTS) library. Currently they don't have a useful
Maven repository that can be used to download snapshots so you'll
have to build it yourself.

h3. Installing missing dependencies

To install some of the dependencies, simply run @./install-deps.sh@.
A sane unix environment is assumed. If not, open the script and run
the equalient commands for your environment.

h3. Building GUTS

pre. svn co https://svn.kenai.com/svn/guts~guts-events/trunk guts~guts-events
cd guts~guts-events
mvn -r clean install -Dmaven.test.skip

h2. How to run

There are currently no installer or packages to install to run
infero, but it can be run from the source tree like this:

pre. mvn -f infero-gui/pom.xml install exec:java -Dmaven.test.skip -Dexec.mainClass=infero.gui.InferoGui

If you really just want to run it remove the @install@ argument.
