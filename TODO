o Look into how the resizing of the panels work. Currently it is
  possible to shrink the panels way too much. Should require the min
  size of the trace panel to be around 200px.

o Look into how tabbing around in the GUI work. It should be an
  easy and natural way to move the focus around.

o Look into shortcut handling. Should be possible to zoom and scroll
  in time with the keyboard.

o Save the state of the windows when changed and reload on start.

o Handle the condition when the GUI is wider than the number of samples.
  Either extrapolate, or just cut the rendering.
